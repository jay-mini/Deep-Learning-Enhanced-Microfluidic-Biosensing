# Deep-Learning-Enhanced-Microfluidic-Biosensing

The prevalence of foodborne bacteria presents a significant public health risk, emphasizing the urgent need for rapid and sensitive detection methods to ensure food safety. This study introduces a novel approach: a deep-learning-assisted microfluidic fluorescence digital analysis technique designed for detecting pathogens at ultra-low concentration.
